# Technology Jupyter Notebooks
This is a repository of a variety of Jupyter Notebooks that I have created. Some are created from work that I've done, while others are from training courses that I have developed and, yet, others from my interests and research.

I will try my best to categorize them and keep them up to date. If you are looking for one related to a particular topic that I don't have, feel free to DM me on Twitter [C_3PJoe](https://www.twitter.com/C_3PJoe) or on [The OSINTion Discord](https://discord.gg/p78TTGA) where my username is C_3PJoe#7635.
